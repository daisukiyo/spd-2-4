# The pixels in the input image are represented as integers.
# The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way:
# Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to
# the average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x
# including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

# Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
